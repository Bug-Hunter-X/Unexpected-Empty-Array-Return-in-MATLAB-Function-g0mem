# Unexpected Empty Array Return in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common MATLAB coding error: a function returning an empty array [] in a conditional branch. This can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors in later parts of the code that assume a numerical value is being returned.

## Problem Description

The `myFunction.m` file contains a MATLAB function with a conditional statement. If a specific condition is not met, it returns an empty array (`[]`). This is problematic if other parts of the code expect a numerical value and perform arithmetic or other operations on it.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function.  It avoids returning an empty array by handling the case appropriately, either by returning a default value, using `NaN` to represent the absence of a numerical result, or providing more comprehensive error handling (e.g., using `error()`).

## How to Reproduce the Error

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.m`. 
3. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.
